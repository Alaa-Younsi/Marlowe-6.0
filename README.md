## 🎯 Evolution & Purpose

This version marks a significant departure from v5.0, focusing on:
*   **Modern User Experience (UX)**: Implementing a clean, card-based layout with clear visual separation between sections.
*   **Enhanced Scannability**: Moving detailed skill lists out of the main navigation and into a dedicated "Blog/Details" section for a cleaner presentation.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: Using typography, spacing, and sectioned design to guide the visitor's attention more effectively.
*   **Professional Showcasing**: Adding a dedicated area for displaying **certificates** as visual proof of skills.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This redesign suggests an advancement in front-end implementation skills:
*   **HTML5 & CSS3**: With a clear focus on modern layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid likely used for the card structures).
*   **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and smooth navigation.
*   **Responsive Design**: The card-based layout inherently adapts well to different screen sizes.

### Newly Mentioned Technology
*   **Sass**: Indicates the adoption of a CSS preprocessor for more organized and powerful styling.
*   **Redux & Vue.js**: Added to the front-end skill list, showing growth in JavaScript framework knowledge.
*   **MongoDB & Raspberry Pi**: Added to the back-end skill list, expanding the range of technical capabilities.

## ✨ Key Features & Redesign Highlights

A comparison with the previous version shows the scale of change:

| Feature | Marlowe v5.0 | Marlowe v6.0 (This Version) | Significance of Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layout & Navigation** | Single, long scrolling page with a sidebar. | **Multi-section page** with a top navigation bar and distinct content "cards". | Improves content organization and modernizes the site's feel. |
| **Skills Presentation** | Listed inline in the "Services" section. | **Separated into core services** (concise) in the main view, with **detailed tech stacks** moved to the "Blog" section. | Creates a cleaner first impression while still providing depth. |
| **Visual Certificates** | Textual recommendations only. | **Dedicated visual showcase** for "Responsive Web Design" and "Javascript" certificates. | Adds credibility and provides tangible proof of learning. |
| **Contact Section** | "Dead Side" with a list of requirements. | **Re-organized "Dead Side"** with requirements as a clean list and the email prominently displayed. | More professional and user-friendly. |
| **Blog Section** | Contained only the narrative story. | Now houses the **detailed skill glossary** ("Front-end Development:", "Back-end Development:", etc.) alongside the narrative. | Better use of the "Blog" as a repository for detailed information. |

## 📁 New Project Structure

The site is now organized into clear, accessible sections:
1.  **Hero / Mission Statement**
2.  **Skills & Current Services** (High-level overview)
3.  **Personal Info**
4.  **Certificates** (Visual gallery)
5.  **Blog** (Detailed skill glossary + personal narrative "Nyctophilia")
6.  **Contact ("Dead Side")**

## 🚀 Professional Development Stage

This overhaul reflects a leap in both design thinking and technical presentation:
*   **Portfolio as a Product**: The site itself now demonstrates modern UI/UX principles, serving as a direct example of front-end skill.
*   **Strategic Content Design**: Shows an understanding of how to layer information for different types of visitors (clients vs. peers).
*   **Evidence-Based Presentation**: The inclusion of certificates shifts from *claiming* skills to *demonstrating* them.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The design philosophy has evolved to emphasize:
1.  **Clarity over Atmosphere**: While the "Marlowe" theme remains, the primary goal is clear, scannable communication.
2.  **Visual Proof**: Using design elements and certificates to build trust.
3.  **Modularity**: The card-based design is reusable and easy to update.
4.  **Professional Accessibility**: Making it as easy as possible for a potential client to understand the offerings and make contact.
